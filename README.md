# Text Colorer

I wrote this program to make it easier to distinguish between program output and other stuff.

## Compiling

The only source file is `main.c`. Compile this using your C compiler to get an executable.

This program uses the `stdio.h` header, so if you are compiling on Linux, you need to install `build-essential` for Debian-based operating systems or an equivalent package for your system.

## How to Use

This program takes input from another program.
